The distancy.py source code looks for the string "distance" in a log file that was passed as an argument. 
The program then finds the number after the string and saves it to max.
It loops through each line in the file and updates the number variable for each new maximum.

The locator.py source code locates and returns the trading thresholds associated with a given strike at a given time.
Once the strike is found in the given file, the output is formatted to show each attribute in the strike

The .idea file contains Pycharm files for the locator.py program
